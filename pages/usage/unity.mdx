# Using Unity with Playroom Kit

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'
import Preview from '../../components/preview'
import Badge from '../../components/badge'
import Image from 'next/image'


<Callout type="info" emoji="🧪">
    The Unity SDK currently only supports **Unity Web.** This is an experimental technology.
</Callout>

Unity is the most popular game engine, it's also a great way to make web games thanks to the [WebGL export option](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-building.html). 

Playroom Kit complements Unity by simplifying the development of multiplayer games and interactive web-based applications.

## Getting started

### Video Tutorial

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1LXWZmJxlKA?si=nKZOaoiEj_WwXt6X" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### 1. Install the SDK

1. Download `playroomkit.unitypackage` from the [releases page](https://github.com/asadm/playroom-unity/releases) (download `playroomkit.unitypackage` file).
2. Drag the package into your Unity project and import all files.
3. Open terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run:

```bash
cd Assets/PlayroomKit
npm install
```

This will install the required dependencies for the SDK.

### 2. Initialize Playroom

In your game's `Start` method, call [`PlayroomKit.InsertCoin`](/apidocs/unity#insertcoininitoptions-callback):

```csharp
using Playroom;

void Start() {
    PlayroomKit.InsertCoin(new PlayroomKit.InitOptions()
    {
        maxPlayersPerRoom = 2,
        defaultPlayerStates = new() {
            {"score", -500},
        },
    }, () =>
    {
        // Game launch logic here
    });
}
```

Now you can use Playroom throughout your game!

### 3. Manage game state

Use [`PlayroomKit.SetState`](/apidocs/unity#setstatestring-key-t-value-bool-reliable--false-void) and [`PlayroomKit.GetState`](/apidocs/unity#getstatetstring-key-t) to handle game state. These automatically sync with other players.

See the [API reference](/apidocs/unity) for more information.

### 4. Exporting to WebGL

To bring your game to the world, you must build! Configure your Build settings to our optimal settings.

1. Go to `File > Build Settings` and select `WebGL` as the platform.
2. In Player Settings:
   - Set `Resolution and Presentation > Run In Background` to `true`.
   - Change `WebGL Template` to `PWA` (or to **DiscordTemplate**, if you want to publish to Discord Activities).
   - Set `Compression Format` to `None` under `Publishing Settings` (this is to make sure the build works with most web servers including [itch.io](itch.io)).
3. Build your game.
4. To test the build locally in your browser, run `python -m http.server` in the resultant build folder. We also recommend using [Servez](https://greggman.github.io/servez/), a simple web server solution with a nice interface. 

<br />

Do note that **PlayroomKit for Unity** only works with WebGL builds.

## Updating from a previous version

Update PlayroomKit for Unity to get the latest features and fixes. We recommend doing the following:
1. Ensure your Unity version is **5+**
2. Delete all `node_modules` folders from your previous installation
3. Add the latest plugin (See [Installation instructions](#1-install-the-sdk)). You **must** re-run `npm install` and get fresh packages.

## Testing your games

PlayroomKit for Unity ships with some helpful features to make multiplayer game dev easier.

### Playroom Dev Manager

The PlayroomKit for Unity plugin includes a "Playroom Dev Manager" panel for multi-instance testing and ease-of-use, which controls two features:
1. [Mock Mode](#mock-mode)
2. [Multiple player testing](#multiple-player-testing)

![Playroom Dev Manager](/images/playroom-dev-manager.png)

### Mock Mode

Since the current SDK only supports Unity Web, we've introduced **Mock mode** - a way to test out your game's logic in Unity's Preview mode, without having to build for web every single time.

#### 1. Local (simulated)
The "Local" mock mode doesn't connect to the actual Playroom servers. Instead, it just mocks the API calls within Unity, and maintains a local state.

**The "Local" Mock mode only works in single player mode for now.** We aim to make it multiplayer by Q4.

| **✅ Pros**                                                                 | **👎 Cons**                                             |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Super fast                                                             | There may be inconsistencies                       |
| Not much setup, lightweight                                            | Can't benchmark network load/bandwidth             |
| Can work offline                                                       | Doesn't have multiplayer (yet), single-player only                                                    |
| No impact on Playroom bill                                             |                                                      |


#### 2. Browser Bridge (live)

This mode connects to a live, multiplayer Playroom server **in the cloud**. It will make real network calls, but to do so, it will launch a controlled browser (to run the underlying network calls).

| **✅ Pros**                                                                 | **👎 Cons**                                             |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Live on Playroom servers, testers can join in from live games                        | Takes time to set up                               |
| Completely accurate according to production                           | Network dependent (can't develop offline)          |
|                                                                          | It may eat up your Playroom bill                  |


##### Setting up the Browser Bridge mock mode

By default, PlayroomKit for Unity runs **local mock mode**. To switch over to Browser mock mode, select the **"Browser Bridge (live)"** option from the "Mock mode" dropdown in the [Playroom Dev Manager](#playroom-dev-manager).

The Browser Bridge mock mode requires some configuration and installation in order to run correctly.

Since the Browser Bridge mock mode on runs a Chrome browser in parallel to the Unity Editor, it requires you to [download the browser driver version](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/#stable) corresponding to your browser version.
Both **need** to be in same version range in order to work correctly. To check and compare versions, check out [this page](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/downloads).

Once downloaded, update the path in the "Unity Browser Bridge (Script)" panel, as shown below.

### Multiple Player testing 
<div style={{display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'row', alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'start', gap: '0.3rem'}}>Status: <Badge style={{background: 'blue', color: 'white', width: 'fit-content', margin: '1rem 0'}}>Beta</Badge></div>

To test with multiple players:

1. Ensure the latest version of the [PlayroomKit plugin](/usage/unity#1-install-the-sdk) is installed.
2. Open the [Playroom Dev Manager](#playroom-dev-manager) panel in Unity.
3. Click "Launch player" to create a new Unity Editor instance.
4. Repeat step 3 for additional player instances (limited by your computer's resources).

This feature uses [ParrelSync](https://github.com/VeriorPies/ParrelSync) Unity Editor to create multiple Unity Editor clones, each representing a different player.

<Callout emoji="🧠">
    **Tip:** Use this method to simulate various multiplayer scenarios and test synchronization between players without deploying your game.
</Callout>
 
By utilizing both Mock Modes and the Multiple Player testing feature, you can thoroughly test your game's multiplayer functionality and performance within the Unity environment before proceeding to a full WebGL build.

## Examples

Check out some simple and advanced use cases!

### Simple Example

Use `WASD` or `Arrow keys` to move the player around. The player's position is synced with other players in real-time.

Code for this example can be found [here](https://github.com/asadm/playroom-docs/tree/main/examples/unity-hello-world).

  ### <summary>How to display player's profile picture in Unity?</summary>

  PlayroomPlayer.GetProfile().photo is formatted as `data:image/svg+xml,{svg encoded for url}`. In order to display it in Unity:
  - Remove `data:image/svg+xml` from the string.
  - Decode the rest using `HttpUtility.UrlDecode()`
  - Display the result into an `SVGImage` component.

  **Warning:** Requires Unity's Vector Graphics package from `com.unity.vectorgraphics`, which is an experimental package.

  ```csharp
   private void LoadSVG(string svgBytes) {
      // Split the string to escape the real data
      svgBytes = svgBytes.Split(",".ToCharArray(), 2)[1];
      // Decode from the URL encoding
      svgBytes = HttpUtility.UrlDecode(svgBytes);
      VectorUtils.TessellationOptions tesselationOptions = new VectorUtils.TessellationOptions();

      using (StringReader reader = new StringReader(svgBytes))
      {
          SVGParser.SceneInfo sceneInfo = SVGParser.ImportSVG(reader);
          tesselationOptions.MaxCordDeviation = float.MaxValue;
          tesselationOptions.MaxTanAngleDeviation = float.MaxValue;
          tesselationOptions.StepDistance = 1f;
          tesselationOptions.SamplingStepSize = 0.1f;

          List<VectorUtils.Geometry> geoms =
          VectorUtils.TessellateScene(sceneInfo.Scene, tesselationOptions);

          // Build a sprite with the tessellated geometry.
          Sprite sprite = VectorUtils.BuildSprite(geoms, 100.0f, VectorUtils.Alignment.Center, Vector2.zero, 128, true);
          sprite.name = "SVGimage";
          profilePicture.sprite = sprite;
      }
  }
  ```

  ### <summary>How to maintain an array of Players in Unity?</summary>

  You can manage a list of players in Unity to track their state and perform actions on them simultaneously. Here’s how to use [OnPlayerJoin](https://docs.joinplayroom.com/apidocs/unity#onplayerjoincallback) and [Player.OnQuit](https://docs.joinplayroom.com/apidocs/unity#onquitcallback):

  ```csharp
  object[] players = Array.Empty<object>();

  PlayroomKit.OnPlayerJoin((player) => {
    players.push(player);
    player.OnQuit(() => {
      Debug.Log($"{player.id} quit!");
      players = players.Where(p => p != player).ToArray();
    });
  });
  ```

  This is similar to the PlayroomKit JavaScript SDK's [usePlayersList hook](https://docs.joinplayroom.com/apidocs/react#useplayerslisttriggeronplayerstatechange-boolean).

  ### <summary>How to do physics over the network?</summary>

#### 1. Is it possible to achieve deterministic physics in Unity for networking?

Deterministic physics in Unity can be quite challenging to achieve due to the nature of the physics engines it uses. Unity uses **PhysX** for 3D physics and **Box2D** for 2D physics, both of which are deterministic by themselves. However, achieving determinism in a game involves more than just the physics engine being deterministic. For example, using the **Rigidbody** component in Unity has a property called **Interpolate** that affects how visuals are interpolated, which can cause differences between `transform.position` and `rigidbody.position`. This can lead to non-deterministic outcomes. For more details, you can check Unity's documentation on [Rigidbody interpolation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/rigidbody-interpolation.html).

#### 2. What are the conditions required for deterministic physics?

To achieve deterministic physics, all inputs (forces, impulses) must be applied to the same objects at the same time across all clients. Any delay in applying these inputs, even by one timestep, can lead to different results. This means that automatic updates of the physics engine in Unity should be disabled, and you should control these updates manually to ensure consistency. You can learn more about this in Unity's documentation on [Physics.Simulate](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Physics.Simulate.html) and the article on [Fix Your Timestep](https://gafferongames.com/post/fix_your_timestep/) by Gaffer On Games.

#### 3. What is floating-point determinism, and why is it important?

Even if you manage to achieve deterministic physics in Unity, floating-point determinism is another hurdle. Different machines with different architectures may calculate floating-point numbers slightly differently, which can cause variations in physics simulations when networking. This can lead to desynchronization across clients. For more information, see the article on [Floating Point Determinism](https://gafferongames.com/post/floating_point_determinism/) by Gaffer On Games.

#### 4. What approach did the developers of Soccer Party use for networking physics?

Given the complexities of achieving deterministic physics, the developers of [Soccer Party](https://soccerparty.playroom.gg/#r=R) decided not to rely on it. Instead, they opted to frequently send position and velocity updates for rigid bodies, and even rotation data in some cases. Their focus shifted to optimizing the size and frequency of these messages rather than ensuring deterministic physics. This approach also requires solutions for handling synchronization issues, such as what to do when objects get out of sync, how to avoid these issues, and how to prevent players from noticing them.

  ### <summary>Which mock mode should I use?</summary>

1. Start with **Local mock mode** for:
- Initial project setup
- Testing new features/algorithms
- Rapid iterations

2. Progress to **Browser Bridge mock mode** for:
- Realistic testing scenarios
- Multiplayer functionality
- Network performance evaluation

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    Remember that both mock modes in the Unity Editor approximate the final WebGL build. Some differences may occur due to the underlying C++ and JS compilation in the web environment.

## Aurea NetLayer: a higher level API for Unity

**GuilhermeAlanJohann** from our Discord community has created a [higher level plugin](https://gitlab.com/PCista/com.aurea.packages.netlayer) for Unity that makes it easier to use Playroom with Unity.

#### Features
- Sync position and rotations of objects over the network (supports interpolation)
- Different object authorities (Host and LocalPlayer)
- Spawn/Unspawn objects over the network
- Send Messages to others (including or excluding yourself)
- RPC (...kind of). It uses Unity message system.
