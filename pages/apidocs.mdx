## `insertCoin({ InitOptions }, [onLaunchCallback], [onDisconnectCallback])`

Tell Playroom to start! Playroom Kit will then handle room creation, players joining and also let players pick their names, colors and avatars. Once host taps "Launch", the promise resolves (and `onLaunchCallback` is called if provided). At this point you can start your game.

```js
// Show Playroom UI, let it handle players joining etc and wait for host to tap "Launch"
await insertCoin();

// Start your game!
```

`InitOptions` is an object with the following properties:

| option       | type    | default | explanation                                                                 |
|--------------|---------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `gameId`    | string  | undefined | The ID of the game from the Playroom developer portal. |
| `streamMode` | boolean | false   | If  `true` , Playroom will start in [ stream mode ]( /multiplayer/stream ). |
| `liveMode`   | string | false   | If set to `tiktok` , Playroom will start in [TikTok Live mode]( /components/tiktok ). |
| `allowGamepads` | boolean | false   | If  `true` , Playroom will let players play game using gamepads connected to the stream device itself. This requires `streamMode` to also be `true`.<br/><br/>The gamepads need to be connected to device where stream screen is running. No phones are required in this mode but are optionally allowed as an alternative controller if there aren't enough physical gamepads in the room. Players who join via phone in this mode see an on-screen [Joystick](/multiplayer/joystick). |
| `baseUrl`    | string  | *Current Page URL*      | The base URL used for generating room link that host shares with other players. |
| `avatars`    | Array&lt;string&gt; | *Default Avatars* | An array of URLs to images that players can pick as their avatar. This will override the default avatars system that Playroom provides. |
| `enableBots` | boolean | false | If 'true' , Playroom initializes a bot using the provided botOptions. |
| `botOptions` | [`BotOptions`](#botoptions) | undefined | An object containing parameters for bot instantiation and configuration. |
| `roomCode` | string | undefined | Override the room to join. If this is not set, a random room code is assigned. Do note that if the URL has room `#r=` param, that is used instead of this.|
| `skipLobby` | boolean | false | Skips the Playroom's lobby screen altogether. This is useful if you want to design your own multiplayer lobby. |
| `reconnectGracePeriod` | number | 0 | If set, Playroom will wait for the given **number of milliseconds** for the player to reconnect to the room after a disconnect. <br/><br/>If the player reconnects within the grace period, the player's state is restored. If the player does not reconnect within the grace period, the player is removed from the room and `onQuit` fires for the player. |
| `maxPlayersPerRoom` | number | undefined | If set, Playroom will set a maximum limit for the **number of players** per room. <br/><br/>If the room is full and a new player attempts to join, the Playroom will display a default modal with a message stating that the "room is full", and the `insertCoin` method will throw an error with a message code `ROOM_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`. <br/><br/>If the room is full, `skipLobby` is set to `true`, and a new player is attempting to join the room, Playroom will skip the default modal but will throw an error.  |
| `defaultStates` | `Object` | undefined | An object containing default game states. These states are set when the room is created. |
| `defaultPlayerStates` | `Object` | undefined | An object containing default player states. These states are set for all players when they join the room. |
| `matchmaking` | [`MatchmakingOptions`](#matchmakingoptions) or `boolean` | false | An object containing matchmaking options or just `true` to enable with default options. |
| `discord`    | boolean  | false | Enable Discord mode. See [Discord Mode](/components/discord) for more information. |

## `maxPlayersPerRoom: number`

Sets a maximum limit for the number of players per room.

```js
  try {
    await insertCoin({
      maxPlayersPerRoom: 2, // maximum limit for 2 players per room
    });
  } catch (error) {}
```

When `skipLobby` is set to `true`, Playroom will skip both the default lobby and the "room is full" modal.

```js
  try {
    await insertCoin({
      skipLobby: true,
      maxPlayersPerRoom: 2,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.message === "ROOM_LIMIT_EXCEEDED") {
      // Here you can display a custom error
    }
  }
```

## `getState(key: string): any`

Returns the current value of the given key in the game state.

```js
const winnerId = getState('winner');
```

## `setState(key: string, value: any, reliable: boolean = true): void`

Sets the value of the given key in the game state. If `reliable` is `true`, the state is synced reliably to all players via Websockets. This is useful for game state that is critical to the game, like the winner. 

If `reliable` is `false`, the state is synced via WebRTC, which is faster but less reliable. This is useful for game state that is not critical to the game, like the player's current position (you can always rely on next position update).

```js
setState('winner', 'player1');
```

## `resetStates(keysToExclude?: string[]): Promise<void>`

Resets all game states to their default values. If `keysToExclude` is provided, those keys are not reset.

```js
await resetStates();
// or
await resetStates(['winner']);
```

## `resetPlayersStates(keysToExclude?: string[]): Promise<void>`

Resets all players' states to their default values. If `keysToExclude` is provided, those keys are not reset.

```js
await resetPlayersStates();
// or
await resetPlayersStates(['score']);
```

## `onPlayerJoin(callback)`

Register a callback that will be called when a new player joins the room. The callback will be called with the player's [`PlayerState`](#playerstate) object.

When you register this callback, it will first run with all existing players and then listen for new players joining the game. This is useful for "catching up" a new player with existing players or getting the full list in a new game scene.

```js
onPlayerJoin((player) => {
  console.log(`${player.id} joined!`);
});
```

## isHost()

Returns `true` if the current player is the host.

```js
if (isHost()) {
  // Do something only the host should do, like reading player input and setting game state
}
```

## `transferHost(playerId: string): Promise<void>`

Allows the current host to assign host privileges to another player in the room.

Accepts playerId as input, identifying the target player.
This function can only be executed by the host.
The transfer will only occur if the target player has not left the room.

```js
try {
  await transferHost(playerId);
} catch (error) {}
```

## `isStreamScreen()`

Returns `true` if the current screen is the stream screen; a non-player screen that is shown when the game is in [ stream mode ]( /multiplayer/stream ).

```js
if (isStreamScreen()) {
  // Do something only the stream screen should do, like showing a countdown
}
```

## `getRoomCode()`

Returns a 4-letter room code of the current room.

## `startMatchmaking(): Promise<void>`

If you didn't pass `matchmaking` option in `insertCoin`, you can start matchmaking manually using this method.

```js
// Insert coin the regular way
await insertCoin({skipLobby: true});
...
// Start matchmaking after all players are in the room
await startMatchmaking();
// Players have joined a public room
```

## `onDisconnect(callback)`

Register a callback that will be called when the current player disconnects from the room. The callback will also be called when current player is kicked from the room.

```js
onDisconnect((e) => {
  console.log(`Disconnected!`, e.code, e.reason);
});
```

## `addBot()`

Adds a bot to the room. This is equivalent to pressing the "Add Bot" button in the lobby. Returns a promise that resolves to an instance of the class you provided in `botOptions.botClass` parameter in `insertCoin`.

```js
const newBot = await addBot();
```

## `myPlayer()` or `me()`

Returns the current player's [`PlayerState`](#playerstate) object.

```js
const player = myPlayer();
console.log(`Hello ${player.getProfile().name}!`);
```

## waitForState(stateKey: string, [onStateSetCallback]): Promise&lt;any&gt;

Returns a promise that resolves to the state value only when the game state has the given key set, to any truthy value.

In other words, it waits until a game state is set. This is useful for waiting for the host to set the winner, for example.

Optionally, you can pass a callback that will be called when the state is set.

```js
// Wait for the winner to be set
const winnerId = await waitForState('winner');
// Do something with the winner
```

## waitForPlayerState(player: [`PlayerState`](#playerstate), stateKey: string, [onStateSetCallback]): Promise&lt;any&gt;

Returns a promise that resolves to the state value only when the player state has the given key set, to any truthy value.

In other words, it waits until a player state is set. This is useful for waiting for a player to play their turn, for example.

Optionally, you can pass a callback that will be called when the state is set.

```js
// Wait for the the player to play their turn
const chosenThing = await waitForState(playerState, 'playedTurn');
// Do something with the thing
```

## `RPC.register(name: string, callback: (data: any, sender: PlayerState) => Promise<any>)`

Register a callback that will be called when a remote procedure call (RPC) with the given name is received from a player. The callback will be called with the data sent by the other player and the [`PlayerState`](#playerstate) object of the caller.

```js
RPC.register('playTurn', (data, sender) => {
  console.log(`${sender.id} played their turn!`);
  return 'ok';
});
```

## `RPC.call(name: string, data: any, mode?: RPC.MODE, callbackOnResponse?: (data: any) => void): Promise<any>`

Call a remote procedure call (RPC) with the given name and data. The `mode` parameter can be used to specify the mode of the RPC call. The default mode is `RPC.Mode.ALL`.

RPCs can be triggered in three different modes:

- `RPC.Mode.HOST`: The RPC is triggered on the host only.
- `RPC.Mode.ALL`: The RPC is triggered on all clients (including the host and the caller).
- `RPC.Mode.OTHERS`: The RPC is triggered on all clients except the caller.

The call returns a promise that resolves to the response from the RPC. Optionally, you can instead pass a callback that will be called when the response is received.

```js

// Trigger an RPC on the host only
RPC.call('playTurn', { thing: 'rock' }, RPC.Mode.HOST);

// Trigger an RPC on all clients (including the host and the caller)
RPC.call('playTurn', { thing: 'rock' }, RPC.Mode.ALL);

// Trigger an RPC on all clients except the caller
RPC.call('playTurn', { thing: 'rock' }, RPC.Mode.OTHERS);
```



## PlayerState
