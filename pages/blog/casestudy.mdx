We’re all in on Discord, and we want you all to join the ride!

Scaling an AI game is no easy feat—we found out the hard way after burning nearly $30,000 in just the first few days. If we had stuck with our original architecture, Playroom would have been finished in a week!

Fortunately, we found amazing support and partnered with incredible teams like [Inworld AI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/inworld-ai/), [ElevenLabs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/elevenlabsio/), [Replicate](https://www.linkedin.com/company/replicate/) and [OpenAI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/openai/) to scale the game. We’ve written a comprehensive case study, in collaboration with [Discord](https://www.linkedin.com/company/discord/), on how to build a successful multiplayer AI game. All the secrets are out!
