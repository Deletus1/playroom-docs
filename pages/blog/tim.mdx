I'm excited to announce that Playroom is leveling up with a legend joining our leadership team. Please welcome [Timothy Johnson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-johnson-dev/), our Founding Technical AI Game Director.

Tim and I have been in deep conversation for weeks, and what brought us together is our shared vision for the future of AI in gaming and the unique opportunities we see on Discord. Tim's track record is impressiveâ€”most recently, he served as CTO at Gallium Studios, where he led groundbreaking AI-driven gameplay projects, including character simulations powered by neural networks.

Tim is a veteran game developer who has crafted many quirky and engaging games for well-known brands like Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, and PBS Kids. He also played a key role in bringing iconic franchises like DC Universe, Westworld, and Harry Potter to life on mobile platforms, captivating millions of players worldwide during his time at WB Games.

Together, we're eager to bring even more fun Social and AI games to life on [Discord](https://www.linkedin.com/company/discord/) in the coming months! ðŸ¥³
